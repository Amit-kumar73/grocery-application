# Grocery Application Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Grocery Application project! This project is a modern, full-stack web application for managing grocery items and lists, built to streamline your shopping experience.

## My Setup Journey

I've personally set up and configured this project from scratch. Here’s an overview of the steps I followed:

### 1. Cloned the Repository

I started by cloning the repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Amit-kumar73/grocery-application.git
cd grocery-application
```

### 2. Installed Dependencies

With Node.js and npm already installed (I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for easy management), I installed all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### 3. Started the Development Server

To begin development and view instant changes, I started the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

### 4. Edited Code

I made changes to the codebase directly using my favorite IDE. All modifications were committed and pushed to this repository, so you can see my progress and improvements in the commit history.

Alternatively, files can be edited directly on GitHub by navigating to the desired file and clicking the pencil icon to make changes.

### 5. Used GitHub Codespaces

For some tasks, I used GitHub Codespaces to quickly spin up an online development environment. This made collaborative coding and review seamless.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
